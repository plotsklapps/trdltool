# TRDLtool

## About

TRDLtool is a web application designed for (trainee) train dispatchers in the 
Netherlands. It simulates the GRI (a specialized telephone system used by ProRail) to create a realistic training environment for communication between an instructor and a trainee.

## How It Works

The tool provides a more immersive training experience, especially when the instructor and trainee are in the same room. Instead of simply talking or shouting across the room, they can simulate actual phone calls as they would occur on the job.

1.  Go to [trdl.tools](https://trdl.tools).
2.  The instructor and the trainee generate a unique GRI code.
3.  This code establishes a live connection between their devices.
4.  They can now simulate calls, making the training feel more authentic.

## Development Status & Disclaimer

This application is a personal project, built with Flutter and Dart by a single developer in their free time.
