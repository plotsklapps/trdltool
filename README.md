# TRDLtool

TRDLtool. Specialized tool for rail professionals.

TRDLtool is a web application designed for (trainee) train dispatchers in the 
Netherlands. It simulates the GRI (a specialized telephone system used by ProRail) to create a realistic training environment for communication between an instructor and a trainee.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

1.  Go to [trdl.tools](https://trdl.tools).
2.  The instructor and the trainee generate a unique GRI code.
3.  This code establishes a live connection between their devices.
4.  They can now simulate calls, making the training feel more authentic.

## Development Status & Disclaimer

This application is a personal project, built with Flutter and Dart by a single developer in their free time.

Please be aware that there might be bugs or missing features. We are actively working on improving the application and appreciate your understanding.
